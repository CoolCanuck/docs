            "text": "What is RetroAchievements.org?\n\n\nRetroAchievements.org\n is a community who collaborate and compete to earn custom-made achievements in classic games through emulation. Achievements are made by and for the community. We provide various custom-built emulators for you to use which will detect when you have completed various challenges. Once logged in, the emulators will post the achievements you've completed back to the site, so you can check and compare your progress to your friends.\n\n\nHere's an example of RAGens, playing Streets of Rage 2. You will see two leaderboard attempt counters (bottom-right), one achievement popping and finally the overlay (press ESC):\n\n\n\n\nWhich emulator do I need to use?\n\n\nThe official RetroAchievements.org emulators are all Windows-based. For other operating systems you can use RetroArch. More information below:\n\n\nOfficial RetroAchievements.org emulators\n\n\nPlease download the emulator of your choice from \nthe download page\n, log in using your username and password, then load a ROM and play! See the following video for a demonstration:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKY2mZjurJw\n\n\nHow do I access the Achievement Overlay?\n\n\nNormally, this will be set up on 'ESC' keyboard key, or the pause function in the game. In most emulators, a game must be active for it to be functional.\n\n\nSome of the emulators should already be setup assigning a controller button to view the achievement overlay. Generally ESC on the keyboard should activate it, but if you want to assign it to a controller, see \nthis link\n.\n\n\nRetroArch emulators\n\n\nFor non-Windows operating systems you need to use \nRetroArch\n.\n\n\nCurrently you can earn achievements via RetroArch on the following platforms:\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nMac\n\n\nAndroid (yes! you can earn cheevos on-the-go with your Android phone!)\n\n\nPS Vita (needs to be hacked with \nHENkaku\n)\n\n\nWii U (needs to be hacked)\n\n\nRaspberry Pi (recommended systems: \nRetroPie\n, \nlakka\n and \nRecalBox\n\n\n\n\nYou can \nget RetroArch here\n.\n\n\nOnce you installed and did the initial configuration, follow this guide to setup Achievements: \nhttps://docs.libretro.com/guides/retroachievements/\n\n\nKeep in mind that not every RetroArch core is compatible with RetroAchievements. \nCheck this list to see wich one to choose\n.\n\n\nMy welcome email has gone missing!\n\n\nUnfortunately sometimes the welcome email has been known to go missing. If this happens, please log in with your username/password you registered with, then visit your settings page.

Unfortunately it is illegal to host or distribute copyright ROMs. To extract the ROM file from your cartridges, you can use a tool such as the Retrode or similar, then you can use the ROM file with our emulators. Other websites host ROM files that you could use with our emulators, but we do not condone downloading or playing ROMs for games you do not own.\n\n\nWhy is my game not loading up achievement?\n\n\nEither:\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn't have achievements,\n\n\nYou have the incorrect rom.\n\n\n\n\nFor more details read this page: \nMy game is not loading achievements\n.\n\n\nIf you are a Linux user, you can use this tool to check if your ROM is OK for RetroAchievements: \nhttps://github.com/meleu/hascheevos\n\n\nWhat is hardcore mode?\n\n\nHardcore mode is an additional feature to separate out the good gamers from the great gamers: Hardcore mode disables \nall\n savestate ability in the emulator: you would not be able to save and reload at any time. You would have to complete the game and get the achievements first time, just like it were on the original console. In reward for this, you will earn both the standard and the hardcore achievement, in effect earning double points! A regular game worth 400 points, is now worth 800 if you complete it fully on hardcore! For example: if you complete the game fully for 400 points, you then have the opportunity to earn another 400 on hardcore.\n\n\nThis achievement didn't trigger! (or triggered at a wrong time)\n\n\nThere's a feature built-in to the \nofficial emulators only\n (not on RetroArch) that allows you to report broken achievements that occur at the wrong time, or not at all. Go to the RetroAchievements -\n Report Broken Achievements.\n\n\nSee this example:\n\n\n.\n\n\nThere's also a detailed video explaining how to use it: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTHbm700Y-Y\n\n\nAdd details of the state of your game, when it triggered/didn't trigger, what game mode, where you were when it happened/didn't happen, if you had reset the game recently, anything else you think may be relevant to the achievement. This is necessary for our system so the devs know where there is a problem.\n\n\nIf you have an evidence of completion you can also contact an admin and the achievement can be manually awarded to you. Make proof and post in the \n#help-me\n in \nDiscord\n the tag @admin. Or send a PM (personal message) to an admin level user.\n\n\nQualified proof:\n Screenshots that show that one is playing in hardcore and have completed the achievment. \nVideo of such (even better)\n. Examples of achievements you've earned that supersede this achievment, e.g. You got the achievment for 10k points but the one for 5k points didn't trigger.\n\n\nHere's a \nperfect example of ideal proof provided by gr1nya\n.\n\n\nI want to make achievements!\n\n\nGood to hear!\n The best place to start is here: \nGetting Started as an Achievement Developer\n.

This will actively display rich presence \n\n\nThe Rich Presence Monitor also supports much more unicode \n\n\nRich presence is displayed every 2 minutes instead of every 10. \n\n\n\n\nLinking:\n \n\n\n\n\nOnly Developers and Admin are allowed to link ROMs to game entries.

Previously it would only go down 5 lines. \n\n\nIn the memory viewport while selecting an address from the \"Watching\" it will put the selected address in focus on the center of the viewport relative to the length of the viewport. \n\n\nWhile putting values into the Mem Viewport you can wrap around the right side instead of getting stopped at 0xf of that line. This allows for quicker corrupting, which can sometimes be useful for finding addresses. \n\n\nWhen deleting a note in the Mem Viewport the selected stays at current address instead of going to 0x0. \n\n\nNotes window has been extended to 5 from 3 lines. \n\n\nNotes window now has word wrap and accept line returns greater than 3. \n\n\nView Notes Button has been added below Delete. \n\n\nMemory Search Range has been added allowing for Custom Range System RAM and Game RAM. \n\n\nSearching for hex values in Given Value is allowed with the prefix 0x. \n\n\n\n\nAchievement Editor:\n\n\n\n\n\"Clone selected\" achievement has been replaced with \"Copy\" and \"Paste\" buttons. \nYou are now able to copy and paste multiple selected requirements within an achievement, to an alt group or to another achievement! \n\n\n\"Delete Selected\" will now delete ALL selected achievements instead of just one at a time.(edited) \n\n\n\n\nRich Presence:\n\n\n\n\nNo longer displays \"Unknown\". It just leaves a blank non-space. Devs this means you don't need to sweat as much about about those knowing every value state of an address in RPS. \n\n\nIf someone is playing a set without achievement or a Rich Presence script it the Rich Presence will say \"Playing [game name]\".\n\n\n\n\n7-November-2017\n\n\nSite Update\n\n\nTime stamps on user, game pages and in many places now show the year. \n\n\nEmulators Update [v0.066]\n\n\nFor RANes, RAGens, RAVBA, and RASnes9x\n \n\n\nGeneral Changes\n\n\n\n\nMore anti-cheat measures were included. \n\n\nSoft IPS patching is removed in the listed emulators. Caused some incompatibilities. \n\n\nIssue with leaderboards popping twice is resolved. \n\n\n\n\nDeveloper Changes\n\n\n\n\nAchievement Editor window is slightly extended. \n\n\nScroll bar retains position when editing longer achievements. \n\n\nIssue with uploading broken badges is fixed. \n\n\n\n\n30-October-2017\n\n\nSite Update\n\n\n\n\nPassword Reset is fixed and working.\nNow if you forget your password you can have a password reset link emailed to you: \nhttp://retroachievements.org/resetPassword.php\n\n\n\n\n6-October-2017\n\n\nSite Update\n\n\nStarted the log\n\n\n\n\nRich Presence has been fixed: \nNow online shows all online players.

In the memory viewport hitting page down will go down 1 page depending on how many addresses you have in view. Previously it would only go down 5 lines.   In the memory viewport while selecting an address from the \"Watching\" it will put the selected address in focus on the center of the viewport relative to the length of the viewport.   While putting values into the Mem Viewport you can wrap around the right side instead of getting stopped at 0xf of that line. This allows for quicker corrupting, which can sometimes be useful for finding addresses.   When deleting a note in the Mem Viewport the selected stays at current address instead of going to 0x0.   Notes window has been extended to 5 from 3 lines.   Notes window now has word wrap and accept line returns greater than 3.   View Notes Button has been added below Delete.

When you run the emulator/game again and load the state being on stage 4, the emulator won't detect that you passed through the previous stages. Then the achievement won't trigger.\n\n\nExample 2: Defeat boss X without taking damage\n\n\nMost likely the conditions to be met in a frame to make this achievement trigger are:\n\n\n\n\nentered the boss room (and memorize this event as something that happened).\n\n\nif take any damage, forget it entered the boss room.\n\n\nbeat the boss.\n\n\n\n\nIn other words: to get this achievement the emulator must \"know\" that you entered the boss room, didn't get any damage, and beated the boss.\n\n\nThe important detail to pay attention here: when you get any damage, the emulator \"forgets\" that you entered the boss room. Then even if you load a state to a point where you didn't get any damage but already entered the room, the emulator won't detect that you entered the room. And then the achievement won't trigger.\n\n\nFinal Words\n\n\nWhen reporting a broken achievement give as many details as possible, \nand don't forget to mention if you are playing on hardcore mode or not\n.\n\n\nIf you want to request an admin to manually award to you an achievement that didn't triggered, be sure to provide a qualified proof.

When all conditions for a particular achievement are met, it is awarded and the emulator stops checking the conditions for that achievement.\n\n\nThe process of creating an achievement basically involves 3 steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding a place in the game's RAM where the information you want is stored (examples: level, life bar, time, coins, holding a weapon, get an item, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate conditions that must be met in order to award an Achievement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest if your achievement is working as expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost likely you'll go back to step 2 and 3 many times to refine the logic of your Achievement.\n\n\nIn this doc we'll see how to accomplish the steps above.\n\n\nAfter you're sure your achievement is triggering at the conditions you want, you can submit it to the server. We'll see more about it later.\n\n\nFirst Steps\n\n\nBefore start ensure you have an RA emulator from the \nRetroAchievements Download Page\n first and \ncreate an account\n so you can log in using the emulator.\n\n\nIn this guide we'll be using RAGens to demonstrate, and the game \nSonic the Hedgehog\n. We are using RAGens but the same applies for the other emulators.\n\n\nTo begin, run the RAGens executable, and login when prompted. Next, use File -\n Open and select whatever ROM you would like to find achievements for.\n\n\nMemory Inspector\n\n\nYou should now have your main window running Sonic. There are 3 other dialogs we'll be using, which can be found under \nRetroAchievements\n in the menu. We'll be dealing with the \nMemory Inspector\n first:\n\n\n\n\nThe Memory Inspector can be used to find addresses in RAM for us to use. Essentially you are on a treasure hunt for memory locations - this dialog will help you examine and filter the game's RAM while the game is running.\n\n\nNOTE: If you want a step-by-step video explanation on finding memory addresses, \nthis video\n can be very useful\n.\n\n\nTo start or restart a test, click \nNew 8-bit Test\n near the top middle.\n\n\nTo keep things simple, we'll start by looking for the memory address which holds the number of rings we have collected. Our steps will be the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad the ROM and start a new game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReset the memory dialog: click \nNew 8-bit Test\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to the game and change the number of rings in memory. For example, collect a ring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the memory dialog, we now want to filter for values that are 'greater than previous values' (symbol \n). We select this, then hit \nFilter\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach time you perform 3 then 4, the number of possibilities or 'candidates' will get smaller. We will continue doing this until the number of candidates reaches a very small number (as few as possible), it might take 4-5 attempts. Next we can click in the results window, and monitor the memory address in the memory viewer at the bottom. Continue using the game and you should see the values in memory change as you collect rings. If you don't, or if something doesn't look right, try another value. With the first Sonic the Hedgehog, the memory address for the number of rings should be \n0xfe20\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: Using save states (F5 to save state, F8 to load state, F6-F7 to toggle which state to use), you can switch back and forth between different states allowing you to alter what is in RAM, and use this to filter out bad candidates. You can search for values that remain the same (I.e. If you know the value didn't change, use \n=\n), or values that are different (use 'not equal', symbol \n!=\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: There's unfortunately no guarantee from game to game on how the developers have stored their data (4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, binary-coded decimals, negative/inverted, i.e. using 0xff/0xffff to represent 'set', or plain randomly), but eventually you should come across some good address. Note if you are struggling to find good values, post \nRetroAchievements.org Development Help forum\n, or \nRetroAchievements Discord server\n. There are plenty of people who will be very happy to help!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n: if you'd like to experiment with memory, try entering new values directly into the RAM viewer. This can have devastating effects on the game, or it might do exactly what you expect, (or nothing at all!) It can be useful though, to see if you can enter a value and get the result you expect. Use with caution!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you've found an address you're happy with, you can write a short note for what it is and hit \nSave Note\n, this will store it on database, and will be automatically restored next time you load up the memory viewer for this game, wherever you are! Note that after clicking 'Save Note', the note will be automatically stored on the database, and shared so all developers will share access to these memory notes. They will all be downloaded afresh when you load a ROM. If you try to overwrite a note, it will check with you first before submitting.\n\n\nYou can find more useful \nMemory Digging Tips here\n.\n\n\nAchievement Sets\n\n\nOK so the memory location for the number of rings is stored at \n0xfe20\n - note to a non-programmer, we're dealing in \nhexadecimal numeral system\n which can be daunting, but don't worry, essentially its just numbers and letters instead of only numbers, and not forgetting \n0x\n at the start to show that it's a memory location in hex. We've found an address we're interested in and stored it using \nSave Note\n. We now want to create a new achievement.\n\n\nGo to the \nRetroAchievements\n in the menu, choose \nAchievement Sets\n and you'll see this dialog:\n\n\n\n\nHere we group all the achievements we know about into three sets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCore Achievements (the main, public Achievement set),\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnofficial/User Achievements (public, but will not award you points: for peer review),\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Achievements (personal to your PC).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Achievements dialog, click \nLocal Achievements\n (top left), then \nAdd New Achievement\n (bottom left). This will add a blank entry to the list in the center. Double click on it: if it's not already open, this should select it and open the \nAchievement Editor\n dialog.\n\n\nAchievement Editor\n\n\nThis is how it looks:\n\n\n\n\nThis is the final dialog where we bring all the data together. Most of the top fields are self explanatory, I.e. Title, Description, Points. The main one is the 'Requirements' part.\n\n\nLet's say we want to add an achievement for collecting a certain number of rings. Let's say 15 rings for simplicity. After filling out the fields at the top and selecting a suitable icon (in this example we used the gold trophy badge (00136), but you can upload a new one), we need to fill out Requirements. We have one requirement, \nthat the number of rings is at least 15\n. Next click is \nAdd New Requirement\n.\n\n\nClicking this button will add several default values to the Requirements list. These defaults just ensure that something relatively sensible is added to the list. For now, ignoring the field 'Special?'. When we clicked create, the default memory value will be whatever value you last left in the memory dialog.\n\n\nNext we will change these values to the following:\n\n\n\n\nSize\n: \n16-bit\n\n\nMemory\n: \n0xfe20\n\n\nCmp\n: \n=\n - this is the comparison to make. We could have any comparison here, but it's sensible to have \"greater than or equal to\". This is important because if we get 10 rings then a super ring box to have 20, we would miss out having \nexactly\n 15 rings.\n\n\nType\n: \nValue\n - we're comparing this memory value to a fixed value: 15\n\n\nSize\n: \nEmpty\n - this is only relevant when comparing memory to memory\n\n\nMem/Val\n: \n15\n - the number of rings required: the value we are comparing the memory to\n\n\nHit Count\n: \n0\n - ignore this for now, its useful for when something needs to happen a certain number of times\n\n\n\n\nWith that set, we don't have any more conditions to add, so we return to the \nAchievements Dialog\n. To be safe, we should save our progress by hitting \nSave Local\n! This saves everything to file locally to ensure that we won't lose any progress.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: usually achievements have more than one requirement to avoid it triggering in a wrong time (i.e. playing demo mode). In this example we are using only one requirement just to simplify the explanation. See more \nAchievement Creation Tips here\n.\n\n\n\n\nTesting the Achievement\n\n\nWe can now 'activate' this achievement locally by hitting \nActivate\n on the right-hand side. This will start monitoring these memory locations and will award the achievement once all the conditions are true. Now we can go ahead and test to see if this achievement works!\n\n\n\n\nIf we press \nEsc\n n-game, you will see the achievement show up as a demonstration of what it would look like in the in-game overlay!\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding Bugs\n\n\nThe cheevo we created in this tutorial is very simple, it has only one condition: \"collected rings \n= 15\". But the address to record the number of collected rings is also used when the game runs in \"demo mode\" (AI playing the game after your wait a while on the title screen). So, if Sonic collect 15 rings on demo mode this achievement will trigger, which is unwanted.\n\n\nSo here are some tips you always have to keep in mind when creating your achievements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever use / Avoid using only one condition as much as you can\n. Otherwise the achievement will most likely pop at the wrong time. This is the \nmost common error by a developer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPauseIf\n Demo Mode\n:  If the game has a demo mode, make sure to find the address for it and add \nmode != demo\n or something similar in your achievements. More info about \nPauseIf\n on the \nAchievement Logic Features page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPauseIf\n cheat codes\n: If the game has a cheat code to increase lives, select stages, etc. Make sure to find the addresses for it and add some kind of protection in your achievements. OK, maybe it's not a very basic topic, but you have to keep it in mind when creating a real achievement set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, the Achievement works. Now What?\n\n\nOnce we have tested that the achievement works locally, there is a two-step commit process:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst in the Achievements Dialog, we select our achievement and press \nCommit Selected\n, and agree to the dialog. This will push our achievement to the server and store it under \nUnofficial User-submitted Achievements\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the achievement to be enjoyed by many, it must be pushed into the \nCore Achievement set\n. For your few first achievements, it must be reviewed by a staff member before it can be pushed to Core. Once you have uploaded a set of achievements to Unofficial, you need to contact an admin who will, using their judgement and personal standards of quality to approve the set and give you a \nDeveloper status\n on the site. In which case you can push any achievement to Core yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaturally, it's best only to submit achievements that are unique and interesting into the Core Achievements group. If there are duplicates in the Core group, the most recently added duplicates will be manually moderated and deleted. If you don't want your achievement in the Core group, or you think it might not be appropriate for the Core group (i.e. if it's incomplete, or if sometimes it appears to trigger when it's not supposed to, like when the game is showing a demo), leave it in the Unofficial/User Submitted section.\n\n\nNext Steps\n\n\nNow that you know how to use the Memory Inspector, and the Achievement Editor. It's time to learn new techniques and practice:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to refine your achievement logic, you can see what features you have in the \nAchievement Logic Features\n page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can learn by looking at existing Achievements that other devs made with an extra explanation in the \nReal Examples\n page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also see some generic examples in the \nAchievement Templates\n page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave fun!",

These tools/options can be used in the Achievement Editor:\n\n\n\n\nFor more help regarding these, our \nDiscord server\n is always open for assistance.\n\n\nDelta Values\n\n\nA \nDelta\n value is the previous frame's value.\n\n\nExamples of how it can be used:\n\n\n\n\nDetect if the level has been increased: \nlevel \n delta level\n. It means \"current level  is greater than the previous frame's level\".\n\n\nDetect damage: \nhealth \n delta health\n. It means \"current health is smaller than the previous frame's health\". Or you can just make the previous frame's value a requirement. \nhealth delta = 1\n means \"the previous frame's value for health must be 1 when the achievement pops up.\"\n\n\n\n\nYou can see how it works in the \nReal Examples page\n.\n\n\nHit Counts\n\n\nIn the Achievement Editor, it's the field on the far right side is Hit Count.\n\n\nZero is default, none. It means the condition must be true when the achievement pops.\n\n\nIf you set a manual hit count, like 1, it means the condition must be true for at least 1 frame, and once that hit count is met, it doesn't need to be met again at any other time.\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n: if a condition has a hit count, and reaches the number required, this condition is no longer tested. It is true and remains true, \nUNLESS\n you have a \nReset If\n, which we will discuss below.\n\n\nYou can see how it works in the \nReal Examples page\n.\n\n\nSpecial Flags\n\n\nIn the Achievement Editor, it's the field titled as \nSpecial?\n\n\nThese flags conditions only work if you set a manual hit count for a condition.\n\n\nPauseIf\n\n\nThis will pause activity for all conditions in the same group.\n\n\nNote\n: Keep in mind this will \nnot\n pause conditions in other groups.\n\n\nThe \nPauseIf\n is used to pause hit count going up during a specific situation (like pausing the game). It's used when you want to keep previously earned hit count, but don't want to reset it when someone simply pauses the game, for example.\n\n\nResetIf\n\n\nThis will reset the hit count for conditions you set a manual hit count for. It's much more common to use than \nPauseIf\n\n\nNote\n: Unlike \nPauseIf\n, this will reset conditions in \nall groups\n\n\nYou can see how it works in the \nReal Examples page\n.\n\n\nN64 Special Flags\n\n\nWhen developing for \nN64\n, there are additional \n\"arithmetic flag operations\"\n that can be used. These flags are currently exclusive to N64. Please note, any condition with arithmetic flags are always considered \ntrue\n, regardless of their comparison values.\n\n\nAdd Source\n\n\nWill add the value of the source in the field labeled \nMemory\n to the next achievement condition. The total value will be used in the next achievement condition.\n\n\nSub Source\n\n\nWorks similarly to \nAdd Source\n, but will instead subtract the source value.\n\n\nAdd Hits\n\n\nWill add the current hit count to the next condition. The total hit value will be used in the next achievement condition.\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, conditions #1 and #2 will have their values (\n5\n and \n3\n respectively) added until they reach condition #3. At that point, the value contained in the \nMemory\n field will be \n5 + 3 + 20\n, and it's new value will be \n28\n.

These are most often refereed to as after-market \nROM trainers\n, are not official, and not in any way supported by Retro Achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemory Digging Tips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can input values in the memory viewer to see if it affects the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you find an address, also search the same region surrounding it and you could find many more useful addresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if something is visibly decreasing in-game, like health, the value isn't necessarily decreasing. It's possible for it to be increasing, so since it's uncommon for you to know for sure, you should just filter \n!=\n and \n==\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you absolutely cannot reduce the results of a filter, you can try guessing some values or at least how the value is acting (\n or \n). For example, no health is usually \n0\n, Stage 1 is usually value \n0\n, Stage 2 is usually value \n1\n depending on the type of game. Another example, maybe each segment of health has 4 pie slices - Should you be searching when \"4\" goes to \"3\" when you lose a slice?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips by Skill Level\n\n\nLevel 1 - Easy\n\n\nStart with 8-bit view in the Memory Viewer. Looking at larger chunks of memory will complicate things, but it will make a seasoned developer's job easier. If you're just starting out and unaware of terms like \nendianess\n and \nbit ordering\n (or when the eyes are tired), its best to make your observations in 8-bit view. Its just easier!\n\n\nLevel 2 - Intermediate\n\n\nBig Data (16 or 32 bit view): Just remember that when adding a 16-bit address that the address to the right comes first.\n\n\nExample: \nAB CD WX YZ\n in 8-bit will becomes \nCDAB YZWX\n in 16-bit.\n\n\nThis is called \"big endian byte ordering\". You can safely ignore the geek-speak by just remembering things are stored \nbackwards\n in 16 bit view and above.\n\n\nRemember that if you are seeing memory in bigger chunks, when you highlight a value, that value now represents a 16 or 32-bit \"chunk\" of memory, and not the 8-bit memory address you may be looking for.  You'll need to drop back down to 8-bit view and highlight the interesting piece if you find something 8-bit that looks interesting.\n\n\nLevel 3 - Advanced\n\n\nAdding support for libretro Little Endian Cores:  N64-specific, most times, when adding support for a libretro LE core to your set, concepts from intermediate apply, with the byte ordering changed slightly. What is seen human readable in 16-bit changes drastically in an LE core's insides.\n\n\nExample:  AB CD WX YZ first takes A's bits, flips them around like looking at them in a mirror, B's bits, flips them around, C's bits... etc, all the way to Z, and then becomes WXYZ ABCD with the bytes from your last step.\n\n\nTo add your LE support, you'll be writing a dummy core condition (Mem 0x000001 = Mem 0x000001), copying your original non-LE conditions with a \nPauseIf\n at the top into one Alt, copy the same conditions to the other. Both \nPauseIf\ns will contain a check looking at a memory address that never changes to see if its 16-bit value has had its byte ordering changed (Think of this as \"\nPauseIf\n I'm not on an LE core\" and \"\nPauseIf\n I am\" alt conditions).\n\n\nOne will run if the gamer is running on an LE core, one wont.  You'll then perform the math I described above on the values you're checking for in the \"\nPauseIf\n I'm not on an LE core\" Alt, and updating it.\n\n\nConfusing? Yes. This is why most beginners and intermediate developers should not worry.\n\n\nAchievement Creation Tips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever use / Avoid using only one condition as much as you can\n. When using only one condition the achievement will most likely pop at the wrong time.  This is the \nmost common error by a developer\n resulting in \"Popped at the Wrong Time\" reasoning attached to Bug Tickets received at RetroAchievements.org.  Write your achievements soundly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPauseIf Demo Mode\n:  If the game has a demo mode (AI plays the game after you wait a while on the title screen), make sure to find the address for it and add \nmode != demo\n or something similar in your achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResetting Happens\n: Some emulators send some addresses in RAM a specific value when reset/reloaded. It's only for the first frame, but it can cause achievements to pop up, so you need to prepare for it. It's usually all one value like FF. You can see the value if you use Frame Advance / Next Frame while resetting the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations\n:  There's a 100 achievement cap, 400 point cap, and a character cap for single achievements (try not to put 50+ conditions in one achievement, that's more love than RetroAchievements can handle!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlt groups\n (left side of editor) are used for \"or\" conditions. The core group is always there and must always be true with at least one alt group being completely true to get the achievement. The entire group is your \"or\" condition. More info on the \nAchievement Logic Features page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid Achievement spam\n. If a game has 100 levels, do not make an achievement for each level. Do every 25 or so.  It is generally looked down upon by RA's development team to code these \"Filler\" type Achievements.  If you intend to create a few progressive unlocks in this manner - the words: (\"Easy\", \"Medium\", \"Hard\") will help to put you in context.  Consider the time segment a casual player would unlock these progressive Achievements in.  If generally you could unlock all in a progressive set of Achievements of this nature in under half an hour as a casual player, that's filler design, and not recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Creative and Fun\n: Get as creative as possible with achievements. \"Beat X without using/doing Y\", \"Beat X in 5 seconds\", \"3 heart run\".  Be sure casual players can still get these with their best effort.  It isn't fun if its way too difficult for a casual player!  (See:  \nBonus Set Tips\n below for the real challenges!). There is a whole page about \nAchievement Design\n that can give good advices on how to think about good achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlitchless, please!\n: Do not make achievements requiring glitches.  Glitches, in most cases, corrupt and destabilize game memory and RAM.  They break the rest of the set to include. It is however, wise to code block walls stopping players from using them to get easy mastery. This is a topic of much debate on RA, since performing a game-breaking glitch sometimes requires a lot of player skill. Some glitches are possible on console-only, some on emulator-only.  For their inconsistency and instability in regards to memory, it is recommended that you blockwall them to protect the integrity of your set and its/your reputation.  (This is an exceptional issue in some GameBoy games, where playground talk in glitching your way to victory was prominent!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe love Art\n:  Pretty badges are rewarding badges! It should visually represent the achievement itself, or hint at the location in the game for secrets.  Matching to the game's art style works well.  Google Image searches for \"Sprite Sheets\" is an useful tip to include some game art. If you're a good graphics artist, updating badges is your time to shine! More info can be found at the \nBadge and Icon Creation page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncheck \"Show Decimal Values\" in the Achievement Editor so you can enter the hex values you see in the Memory Viewer.  Its better than using a programmers calculator!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16-bit Secrets\n: 16-bit requirements do not have to be used on an even number of RAM, they can be used in-between properly, even if 16-bit view doesn't show it right. Ex: 0 1 2 3 4 5, in 16-bit it's usually viewed as 10 32 54, but if you start the address at the 1 here in your requirement, \"21\" will be read by the achievement, even if 16-bit view in the memory viewer isn't showing it. It also works if it's the last address in the line(starting at F, going to 0).  Be aware that if you're coding for LE cores as well, you'll have to update this, too!  Always leave descriptive code notes for yourself or someone else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBit field Secrets\n: Use single bits(0-7) for things that only change a single bit. In the Memory Viewer, when an address is selected, there will be \"bits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\" above the addresses, and below those numbers will be either \"0\" or \"1\" like \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" if bit3 has a 1 under it, bit3=1 for that address. Single bit usage is very common for game events/unlocks/etc.. You'll want to use these in games where you can do things in different orders, dialogues, events, unlocks.. If you check for \"8-bit x = 7\" and someone did something different like skip something or get something extra, their 8-bit value will very likely be different because the single bits within are different and the achievement won't unlock, so in this case you check for specific bits inside the 8-bit address. Now if for example, item unlocks use all 8 bits of the 8-bit address, and you want to do \"unlock all items,\" you can just do \"8-bit x = 0xff\" This may be confusing, but it's very important to understand.  Some games with limited memory space use bit fields a lot!  Its an important technique to learn.",

If you absolutely cannot reduce the results of a filter, you can try guessing some values or at least how the value is acting (  or  ). For example, no health is usually  0 , Stage 1 is usually value  0 , Stage 2 is usually value  1  depending on the type of game. Another example, maybe each segment of health has 4 pie slices - Should you be searching when \"4\" goes to \"3\" when you lose a slice?",

Remember that if you are seeing memory in bigger chunks, when you highlight a value, that value now represents a 16 or 32-bit \"chunk\" of memory, and not the 8-bit memory address you may be looking for.

What is seen human readable in 16-bit changes drastically in an LE core's insides.  Example:  AB CD WX YZ first takes A's bits, flips them around like looking at them in a mirror, B's bits, flips them around, C's bits... etc, all the way to Z, and then becomes WXYZ ABCD with the bytes from your last step.  To add your LE support, you'll be writing a dummy core condition (Mem 0x000001 = Mem 0x000001), copying your original non-LE conditions with a  PauseIf  at the top into one Alt, copy the same conditions to the other. Both  PauseIf s will contain a check looking at a memory address that never changes to see if its 16-bit value has had its byte ordering changed (Think of this as \" PauseIf  I'm not on an LE core\" and \" PauseIf  I am\" alt conditions).  One will run if the gamer is running on an LE core, one wont.  You'll then perform the math I described above on the values you're checking for in the \" PauseIf  I'm not on an LE core\" Alt, and updating it.  Confusing? Yes.

            "text": "Never use / Avoid using only one condition as much as you can . When using only one condition the achievement will most likely pop at the wrong time.  This is the  most common error by a developer  resulting in \"Popped at the Wrong Time\" reasoning attached to Bug Tickets received at RetroAchievements.org.  Write your achievements soundly.    PauseIf Demo Mode :  If the game has a demo mode (AI plays the game after you wait a while on the title screen), make sure to find the address for it and add  mode != demo  or something similar in your achievements.    Resetting Happens : Some emulators send some addresses in RAM a specific value when reset/reloaded. It's only for the first frame, but it can cause achievements to pop up, so you need to prepare for it. It's usually all one value like FF. You can see the value if you use Frame Advance / Next Frame while resetting the game.    Limitations :  There's a 100 achievement cap, 400 point cap, and a character cap for single achievements (try not to put 50+ conditions in one achievement, that's more love than RetroAchievements can handle!).    Alt groups  (left side of editor) are used for \"or\" conditions. The core group is always there and must always be true with at least one alt group being completely true to get the achievement. The entire group is your \"or\" condition. More info on the  Achievement Logic Features page .    Avoid Achievement spam . If a game has 100 levels, do not make an achievement for each level. Do every 25 or so.  It is generally looked down upon by RA's development team to code these \"Filler\" type Achievements.  If you intend to create a few progressive unlocks in this manner - the words: (\"Easy\", \"Medium\", \"Hard\") will help to put you in context.  Consider the time segment a casual player would unlock these progressive Achievements in.  If generally you could unlock all in a progressive set of Achievements of this nature in under half an hour as a casual player, that's filler design, and not recommended.    Be Creative and Fun : Get as creative as possible with achievements. \"Beat X without using/doing Y\", \"Beat X in 5 seconds\", \"3 heart run\".  Be sure casual players can still get these with their best effort.  It isn't fun if its way too difficult for a casual player!  (See:   Bonus Set Tips  below for the real challenges!). There is a whole page about  Achievement Design  that can give good advices on how to think about good achievements.    Glitchless, please! : Do not make achievements requiring glitches.  Glitches, in most cases, corrupt and destabilize game memory and RAM.  They break the rest of the set to include. It is however, wise to code block walls stopping players from using them to get easy mastery. This is a topic of much debate on RA, since performing a game-breaking glitch sometimes requires a lot of player skill. Some glitches are possible on console-only, some on emulator-only.  For their inconsistency and instability in regards to memory, it is recommended that you blockwall them to protect the integrity of your set and its/your reputation.  (This is an exceptional issue in some GameBoy games, where playground talk in glitching your way to victory was prominent!)    We love Art :  Pretty badges are rewarding badges! It should visually represent the achievement itself, or hint at the location in the game for secrets.  Matching to the game's art style works well.  Google Image searches for \"Sprite Sheets\" is an useful tip to include some game art. If you're a good graphics artist, updating badges is your time to shine! More info can be found at the  Badge and Icon Creation page .    Uncheck \"Show Decimal Values\" in the Achievement Editor so you can enter the hex values you see in the Memory Viewer.  Its better than using a programmers calculator!    16-bit Secrets : 16-bit requirements do not have to be used on an even number of RAM, they can be used in-between properly, even if 16-bit view doesn't show it right. Ex: 0 1 2 3 4 5, in 16-bit it's usually viewed as 10 32 54, but if you start the address at the 1 here in your requirement, \"21\" will be read by the achievement, even if 16-bit view in the memory viewer isn't showing it. It also works if it's the last address in the line(starting at F, going to 0).  Be aware that if you're coding for LE cores as well, you'll have to update this, too!  Always leave descriptive code notes for yourself or someone else.    Bit field Secrets : Use single bits(0-7) for things that only change a single bit. In the Memory Viewer, when an address is selected, there will be \"bits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\" above the addresses, and below those numbers will be either \"0\" or \"1\" like \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" if bit3 has a 1 under it, bit3=1 for that address. Single bit usage is very common for game events/unlocks/etc.. You'll want to use these in games where you can do things in different orders, dialogues, events, unlocks.. If you check for \"8-bit x = 7\" and someone did something different like skip something or get something extra, their 8-bit value will very likely be different because the single bits within are different and the achievement won't unlock, so in this case you check for specific bits inside the 8-bit address. Now if for example, item unlocks use all 8 bits of the 8-bit address, and you want to do \"unlock all items,\" you can just do \"8-bit x = 0xff\" This may be confusing, but it's very important to understand.  Some games with limited memory space use bit fields a lot!  Its an important technique to learn.",

            "text": "This doc has some suggestions about difficulty, set balance and on keeping a set fun, approachable, and challenging. What you're going to see here are not rules, just suggestions.\n\n\nNote\n: be aware of \nDevelopers Code of Conduct\n\n\nDifficulty Scale:\n\n\n\n\nFreebie\n\n\nEasy\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMed-hard\n\n\nHard\n\n\nVery-Hard\n\n\nSuper-Hard\n\n\n\n\nMore details on these \nat the bottom\n.\n\n\nIn general there should be an steady sloping balance of difficulty. One should think of the overall difficulty of a set while building it. One should not make sets excessively difficult.\n\n\nA good set balance on a 50 cheeves in an average set would have roughly: 4 freebies, 6 easy cheeves, 10 medium, 10 med-hard, 14 hard, and 6 very-hard, 0 kaizo.\n\n\nA well balanced difficulty distribution has rewards for every type of player. It gives each skill level something to accomplish until mastery.\n\n\nAchievements should not just be a check-mark of completing a game\n, (too easy) but create fun new memories for the game (diversity of challenges).\n\n\nIt leaves space for freebies that are featuring curious or fun elements of the game. It expects enough difficulty that once you've mastered the set you are a master of the game. But it doesn't ask too much from the player either.\n\n\nIt also shouldn't ask the player to be doing seemingly endless repetitive grinding to make a set seem harder. Doing the same task over and over isn't hard, it's typically dull. It should almost always avoid making marathon types with a hill at the end (ones that require long setup times with low or repetitive difficulty and then a spike of high difficulty at the end. Don't do it!).\n\n\nSets should be mastereable by a skilled player who gives a dedicated effort.\n\n\nSets should reflect the content of the game. Grinding cheeves in games that require grinding are reasonable, where in other places they would often be inappropriate.\n\n\nSets should also break out of just what is expected from a game, pushing the player to need to find new solutions for problems a veteran player never considered.\n\n\nSet Quantity:\n\n\nSet quantity should not have such hard rules. Quality is the key factor.\n\n\nThe set quantity strongly depends on how much fun and challenges the game can give. That's why the set developer must know the game very well.\n\n\nSet Variety:\n\n\nKeep it fun, give it variety, challenge the player, give the player new things to do.\n\n\nSome achievements can give much fun to the player when they are like a meta-game. Where the player is required to rethink the game entirely.\n\n\nSome notable examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFabulous ComboFabulous Combo (15)\n - it turns the game into a puzzle game, completing this can be really satifying\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwordless Adventurer (20)\n - with no sword you are forced to rethink the entire game. You can discover how useful all the subweapons are. Very fun!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere Are No Bullets in the Energy Zone (10)\n - pacifist challenges, when possible force a lot more agility from the player and break old habits. Very fun!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of Difficulty\n\n\n0 - freebie\n\n\nTakes almost no effort for basically all players to achieve this OR the player gets it without any conscious effort. The player gets these on accident and they pop up on the screen. Sometimes the player will have no idea why they earned them. Some freebies are good some are bad.\n\n\nExamples:\n Starting the game, picking a character, collecting an easily accessible item, killing your first enemy. Stumbling on a cheeve that took no forethought but highlights elements of the game.\n\n\n1 - Easy\n\n\nMost players could get these on their first attempt, Some on their second or third attempt. Rarely players can mess it up.\n\n\nExamples:\n Progress on easy stages, getting 100 coins, collecting a feather, collecting 20 rings. Getting the first upgrade, getting to a well known secret stage. Fighting a simple boss: most bosses in Super Mario World, completing early stages in Sonic.\n\n\n2 - Medium\n\n\nMany players could get this on their first attempt. Many could after a few attempts. Some will need to practice. Very few will struggle with them.\n\n\nExamples:\n Getting all the colored switches in Super Mario World, collecting all of the items in a Castlevania stage, getting a bonus item in a more hidden area, like moons in SMW. Beating Contra with the Konami code.\n\n\n3 - Medium-Hard\n\n\nA low amount of players could get this on their first attempt. Some after a few attempts and most will take some effort and practice to complete these. A few will find them very challenging, and give up.\n\n\nExamples:\n Getting some of the chaos emeralds in Sonic 2. Beating Super Mario World.\n\n\n4 - Hard\n\n\nVery few player can get these on their first attempt, perhaps if they already know the game (not really a first attempt is it?) Most can complete these with a solid effort, many attempts and some practice, and some need to practice other games first.\n\n\nExamples:\n Getting all of the Chaos emeralds in Sonic 1,2,3.

One should think of the overall difficulty of a set while building it. One should not make sets excessively difficult.  A good set balance on a 50 cheeves in an average set would have roughly: 4 freebies, 6 easy cheeves, 10 medium, 10 med-hard, 14 hard, and 6 very-hard, 0 kaizo.  A well balanced difficulty distribution has rewards for every type of player. It gives each skill level something to accomplish until mastery.  Achievements should not just be a check-mark of completing a game , (too easy) but create fun new memories for the game (diversity of challenges).  It leaves space for freebies that are featuring curious or fun elements of the game. It expects enough difficulty that once you've mastered the set you are a master of the game. But it doesn't ask too much from the player either.  It also shouldn't ask the player to be doing seemingly endless repetitive grinding to make a set seem harder. Doing the same task over and over isn't hard, it's typically dull. It should almost always avoid making marathon types with a hill at the end (ones that require long setup times with low or repetitive difficulty and then a spike of high difficulty at the end. Don't do it!).  Sets should be mastereable by a skilled player who gives a dedicated effort.  Sets should reflect the content of the game. Grinding cheeves in games that require grinding are reasonable, where in other places they would often be inappropriate.  Sets should also break out of just what is expected from a game, pushing the player to need to find new solutions for problems a veteran player never considered.",

            "text": "Currently Leaderboards can be edited by developers on the website. It's a pretty hefty interface and a difficult job to get a leaderboard working just right. It genuinely takes some care and attention to get a good leaderboard working, so in this doc we'll try to understand how it works.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThis is how a game's Leaderboard List looks like on the website:\n\n\n\n\nIn the center you can see every already made Leaderboard, and in the right column you can see the \nCode Notes\n for the game. The Code Notes are here to help with some conditions we'll see below.\n\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each field of a single Leaderboard:\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: the leaderboard's title.\n\n\nDescription\n: the leaderboard's description.\n\n\nFormat\n: it can be \nScore\n, \nTime (Frames)\n, \nTime (Milliseconds)\n or \nValue\n. It's used to distinguish what sort of leaderboard this is (we'll go into this below).\n\n\n\"LowerIsBetter\" checkbox\n: when checked, it means that a lower value is a better thing. It's usually the case for time based leaderboards, whereas a larger score generally is better.\n\n\nStart\n: start conditions, aka \nSTA\n.\n\n\nCancel\n: cancel conditions, aka \nCAN\n.\n\n\nSubmit\n: submit conditions, aka \nSUB\n.\n\n\nValue\n: a value interpreter, aka \nVAL\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: A valid leaderboard MUST have all four of these conditions.\n\n\nThose last 4 fields are really important and \nLOTS\n of care must be taken over the entry of any characters into these strings. That's why they deserve a further explanation:\n\n\nThe \nSTA\n or \nStart\n condition is a series of values, like an achievement, that must be true in order to start looking for a leaderboard submission. Once the \nSTA\n is true, the game will activate the other three, and will keep processing them constantly.\n\n\nIf a \nCancel\n (\nCAN\n) condition is true, then it will cancel all progress towards the leaderboard submission. If however the \nSubmit\n (\nSUB\n) condition is true, then the leaderboard entry will be submitted.\n\n\nFinally, the \nValue\n (\nVAL\n) is a special case, and will be taken from memory using the formula stated in the memory box.\n\n\nAddress Format\n\n\nThe memory addresses for STA/CAN/SUB/VAL have the following format:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlocation/size\n\n\nprefix (the letters can be in lower case)\n\n\nexample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit0\n\n\n0xM\n\n\n0xM01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit1\n\n\n0xN\n\n\n0xN01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit2\n\n\n0xO\n\n\n0xO01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit3\n\n\n0xP\n\n\n0xP01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit4\n\n\n0xQ\n\n\n0xQ01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit5\n\n\n0xR\n\n\n0xR01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit6\n\n\n0xS\n\n\n0xS01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit7\n\n\n0xT\n\n\n0xT01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLower4\n\n\n0xL\n\n\n0xL01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpper4\n\n\n0xU\n\n\n0xU01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8bit\n\n\n0xH\n\n\n0xH01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16bit\n\n\n0x\n\n\n0x01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32bit\n\n\n0xX\n\n\n0xX01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe best place to start is to look at one of the existing leaderboards \nhttp://retroachievements.org/leaderboardList.php\n and break it down to see how it works. We're going to use the \nGreen Hill Act 1 (Sonic the Hedgehog) Leaderboard\n for this purpose. Then let's see how it looks:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nTitle/Description\n fields are quite obvious.\n\n\nThe \nType\n is \"Time (Frames)\". In Sonic every 60 frames is 1 second, then we'll monitor the time using the frames.\n\n\nThe \nLower Is Better\n flag is checked, then the one who makes the shortest time will be the #1.\n\n\nNow we're going to break down the most important parts.\n\n\nStart Conditions\n\n\nSTA\n: \n0xfe10=h0000_0xhf601=h0c_d0xhf601!=h0c_0xfff0=0\n\n\n\n\n0xfe10=h0000\n: If RAM address 0xfe10 is equivalent to hex 0000,\n\n\n_\n: AND,\n\n\n0xhf601=h0c\n: If 8-bit RAM address 0xf601 is equivalent to hex 0c,\n\n\n_\n: AND,\n\n\nd0xhf601!=h0c\n: If the previous 8-bit RAM address 0xf601 is NOT equivalent to hex 0c,\n\n\n_\n: AND,\n\n\n0xfff0=0\n If RAM address 0xfff0 is equivalent to 0.\n\n\n\n\nThis might seem daunting, because we don't know what these addresses mean. That's why the \nCode Notes\n in the right column are pretty handy! You can see how these addresses are labelled in memory. In our example we have:\n\n\n\n\n0xfe10 is the level, and is expected to be 0 (the first level).\n\n\n0xf601 is an 8-bit memory address, and we use the prefix '0xh' instead of '0x' to signify this. 0xf601 is the screen mode. The second and third parts of this start statement are saying 'the current mode should be 'ingame' (0c), and the previous mode should NOT be 'ingame'. Note that 'd' represents delta, or \"the previous frame's value\". In other words, trigger this if we've JUST arrived in a level (the start of the level, when we want to start testing their time).\n\n\nFinally we also expect 0xfff0 to be equivalent to 0, because 0xfff0 is the demo mode, and we don't want to award a leaderboard entry when the demo is active!\n\n\n\n\nCancel Conditions\n\n\nCAN\n: \n0xhfe13\nd0xhfe13\n\n\n\n\n0xfe13 is the number of lives.\n\n\n\n\nThe cancel section checks if the player's LIVES counter ever becomes lower. Literally, it says \"Cancel if the CURRENT value at 0xfe13 is less than the PREVIOUS value at 0xfe13\". We want to do this because you could reach the final checkpoint and run out of time, resetting your timer to 0:00. We don't want to allow this, because it's not the correct way of completing the level. So if the player dies, we reset their leaderboard progress.\n\n\nSubmit Conditions\n\n\nSUB\n: \n0xf7cc!=0_d0xf7cc=0\n\n\n\n\n0xf7cc is the endlevel flag, non-interactive.\n\n\n\n\nThe submit section checks if the current frame has the 'endlevel' flag set to true (or \n!=0\n, 'nonzero'), and the previous frame (delta) has it set to false (or \n=0\n, 'zero'). This suggests that the player has reached the end of the level, and has proven to be a fairly sturdy benchmark.\n\n\nTip\n: it can be useful to watch these values in memory to see how they perform, and what sort of values they end up at in different circumstances.\n\n\nValue Interpreter\n\n\nVAL\n: \n0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600\n\n\nFinally, value. Once the player has reached the start condition, they will be shown a popup which remains on-screen, showing their progress so far. If it's a time leaderboard, it will be a clock, and if it's a score, it will just be the value. If they fulfill the cancel condition, they will be told that they have failed, and the popup will be removed. If they successfully reach the submit condition, the current value will be taken and submitted as their score, and on successful submission, an ingame popup will inform the player of the leaderboard so far, and their position in the leaderboard.\n\n\nThe value condition is special in a few ways. It is evaluated constantly and shown on-screen all the time when the leaderboard is active. It doesn't work like the other conditions, it expects addresses in the following way:\n\n\naddress*modifier\n (address times modifier)\n\n\nand it uses the \n_\n underscore operator as a 'plus'.

The Code Notes are here to help with some conditions we'll see below.  Here's a brief explanation of each field of a single Leaderboard:   Title : the leaderboard's title.  Description : the leaderboard's description.  Format : it can be  Score ,  Time (Frames) ,  Time (Milliseconds)  or  Value . It's used to distinguish what sort of leaderboard this is (we'll go into this below).  \"LowerIsBetter\" checkbox : when checked, it means that a lower value is a better thing. It's usually the case for time based leaderboards, whereas a larger score generally is better.  Start : start conditions, aka  STA .  Cancel : cancel conditions, aka  CAN .  Submit : submit conditions, aka  SUB .  Value : a value interpreter, aka  VAL .   Note : A valid leaderboard MUST have all four of these conditions.  Those last 4 fields are really important and  LOTS  of care must be taken over the entry of any characters into these strings. That's why they deserve a further explanation:  The  STA  or  Start  condition is a series of values, like an achievement, that must be true in order to start looking for a leaderboard submission. Once the  STA  is true, the game will activate the other three, and will keep processing them constantly.  If a  Cancel  ( CAN ) condition is true, then it will cancel all progress towards the leaderboard submission. If however the  Submit  ( SUB ) condition is true, then the leaderboard entry will be submitted.  Finally, the  Value  ( VAL ) is a special case, and will be taken from memory using the formula stated in the memory box.",

This might seem daunting, because we don't know what these addresses mean. That's why the  Code Notes  in the right column are pretty handy! You can see how these addresses are labelled in memory. In our example we have:   0xfe10 is the level, and is expected to be 0 (the first level).  0xf601 is an 8-bit memory address, and we use the prefix '0xh' instead of '0x' to signify this. 0xf601 is the screen mode.

To have RP in a game you need a Rich Presence Script \n(RPS)\n which is created by Developers. The Script check the player's game memory and as programmed reports the values of certain addresses with definitions assigned by the Developer such as which stage the player is on, how many lives they have, if the game is paused, what game mode they are playing, what the player has accomplished, etc. This information is reported back to the website. \nEvery game published needs at least a basic RPS.\n\n\nExample of RP in action:\n\n\n  \n\n\nTo see the RP live in a game click on the RetroAchievements menu in your emulator and then click on Rich Presence Monitor. A small window will show you your active RP. (Good for debugging)\n\n\n\n\nThe best way to understand Rich Presence is to look at various examples in game, look at the addresses used and look at how the text is displayed in the Rich Presence Monitor and on site.\n\n\nHow Does it work?\n\n\nEvery time a game is launched, it fetches the achievements in a 'patch' file for the ROM which details all the achievements and memory addresses (and leaderboards) that can be watched for. It will also request a Rich Presence Script for the currently loaded ROM. The emulator will report back to the website every 120 seconds. Similarly, every 120 seconds or so, the 'active players' box on the frontpage will refresh, detailing the last known activity of all active players. If there isn't a rich presence script given, the text will be 'earning achievements' if playing a game with achievements, 'playing [game]' if playing a game without achievements, or 'developing achievements' if the memory dialog is open and visible. \n\n\nThe RPS for each game can be found under the development section on each game's page: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample (Super Mario Bros.)\n\n\nFormat:Digit\nFormatType=VALUE\n\nLookup:Mode\n0=[Demo] \n2=[World Complete] \n\nLookup:Paused\n0x81=\u258c\u258c \n0x80=\u258c\u258c \n1=\u258c\u258c \n\nLookup:Star\n5=\ud83c\udf1f \n4=\ud83c\udf1f \n3=\ud83c\udf1f \n2=\ud83c\udf1f \n1=\ud83c\udf1f \n\nLookup:Powerup\n0=Small\n1=Super\n2=Fire\n\nLookup:Swimming\n1= swimming\n\nLookup:Status\n0= [Loading]\n1= taking a vine warp\n2= entering a warp pipe\n3= entering a warp pipe\n4= \ud83d\udea9\n5= [Stage Complete]\n6= [Game Over]\n7= [Entering Area]\n9= growing\n0xA= shrinking\n0xB= \ud83d\udc80\n0xC= powering up\n\nLookup:Quest\n0x0=1st\n0x1=2nd\n\nDisplay:\n@Mode(0xh770)@Paused(0xh776)@Star(0xM79f_0xN79f_0xo79f_0xP79f_0xQ79f_0xR79f)@Powerup(0xh0756) Mario in @Digit(0xh75f_v1)-@Digit(0xh75c_v1)@Swimming(0xh704)@Status(0xhe), \ud83d\udeb6:@Digit(0xh75a_v1), @Quest(0xh7fc) Quest\n\n\n\n\nIt breaks down into a series of Lookup objects, Format objects and one Display object. \n\n\nLookups\n\n\nLookups are defined like this: \n\n\nLookup:NameOfLookup\nValue1=Text When This Value\nValue2=Text When Another Value\n...\n\n\n\n\nWe give the Lookup a value, consisting of a series of memory addresses and modifiers.

If the next line starts with a question mark, it is considered to be a conditional display string. The portion of the line between the two question marks is the conditional clause. If the conditional clause evaluates true, then the remaining portion of the line is used as the display string. If it does not evaluate true, then processing proceeds to the next line. If it starts with a question mark, the same process repeats. If it does not start with a question mark, the entire line is used as the default display string.\n\n\nLooking at this example, if the 16-bit value at $0085 is 0, the display string is \nTitle Screen\n. If not, the next line is examined. If the 7th bit of $007C is 1, the display string is \nCustom Map in @Landscape(0xH00016c)\n. If not, the final line does not have a conditional clause and is used.\n\n\nDisplay strings associated with a conditional clause support all of the same syntax as the default display string. In this example, you can see the \n@Landscape\n lookup is used in both the conditional display string and the default display string. The lookup itself only has to be defined once.\n\n\nThe conditional phrase supports all of the previously mentioned address accessors as well as AND (_) and OR (S) logic.

Other character prefixes work? (untested).\nWhen you use the b prefix and the address is stored as a BCD your out put for an address that is 10 will be 10 instead of 16 (which is 10 in hex).\n\n\nThis is most commonly used for score and time, but often other types of display values.\n\n\nLimits\n\n\n\n\n2500 character limit for script  \n\n\n100 character limit for what is displayed  \n\n\nUnicode characters are allowed  \n\n\nUsing \n in text will cut off the script after the \n  \n\n\nUsing the character \n+\n Will not display  \n\n\n\n\nSyntax Details\n\n\n\n\nThe RPS ignores trailing 0s in hex address lookups and values \n0x00001\n == \n0x1\n, \n0xh0000245\n == \n0xh245\n, \n0x0a\n == \n0xa\n.\n\n\nLookup values are Decimal by default and hex if you place the prefix of \n0x\n. This mean \n1\n == \n0x1\n, \n2\n == \n0x2\n, \n9\n == \n0x9\n, \n10\n == \n0xa\n, \n100\n == \n0x64\n, etc.  \n\n\n\n\nTips and Tricks\n\n\n\n\nLookups must be case specific with their corresponding @ in the display and not contain spaces after the lookup is defined.\n\n\nLookup names can be as short as a single character if you need to squeeze in a few extra characters.\n\n\nTurning all your values from hex into decimal will take up less characters.\n\n\nUnicode characters don't always \"take up less space\" they often take up to four system characters.\n\n\nIf you do not define your lookups they will be left blank (no space). This is only true for NES, SNES, Gen, RAVBA. N64, Meka and Lynx will leave the word \"Unknown\" each time you don't define a lookup.\n\n\nYou only need one value format object. You can reference it with multiple addresses. (is this always true?)\n\n\nPutting spaces in your lookups sometimes before or after can allow you to hide certain lookups when they are not needed, like how \n@Pause\n, \n@Star\n, \n@Swimming\n, and @Mode do. \n\n\n\n\nValue Properties\n\n\nWhen using lookup and format objects \n@object()\n it's possible to combine and perform calculations. This can be used to correctly display a score, in game time, etc. or make more advanced lookups.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n@Score(0x28*10_0x29*1000_0x26*100000) points\n \n\n\nThis means use the Lookup or Format \nScore\n, and give it the sum of:\n\n- 0x28 times 10, ADD\n\n- 0x29 times 1000, ADD\n\n- 0x26 times 100000  \n\n\n\n\n_\n adds the addresses together.  \n\n\nOr you can add a static value \n0x28_v10\n. This adds 10 to your total, as in whatever the value of \n0x28\n + 10 will be displayed. You can also subtract \n0x28_v-10.\n  \n\n\nIf you'd like to subtract an address you need to multiply the address by -1. \n0x29*-1\n. \n0x29\n is now negative.  \n\n\nIf you'd like to perform division you'll need to multiply by a decimal.  \n0x26*.5\n. \n0x26\n will output 1/2 of the value at \n0x26\n.  \n\n\nAnd you can string everything together: \n0x28*10_0x29*-1_0x26*.625_v-10\n.\n\n\nYou can also add addresses together to give you lookups based on the sums of various addresses. This is used in the example in @Star. It's looking up sum the 6 lowest bits of the address 0xh79f. The way this address works is that so long as there is a value there Mario is invincible star mario and it counts down from hex value 0x23 (35 decimal) to 0. 23 in binary is 0010 0011 meaning the max sum of these bits could 5 during 0001 1111 when the count down reaches hex value 0x1f (31 decimal).\n\n\n\n\nUnicode Standard Symbols\n\n\n\u258c\u258c=Paused\n\n\ud83d\udd01=Loop number\n\n\ud83d\udeb6=Lives.

To have RP in a game you need a Rich Presence Script  (RPS)  which is created by Developers. The Script check the player's game memory and as programmed reports the values of certain addresses with definitions assigned by the Developer such as which stage the player is on, how many lives they have, if the game is paused, what game mode they are playing, what the player has accomplished, etc. This information is reported back to the website.  Every game published needs at least a basic RPS.  Example of RP in action:      To see the RP live in a game click on the RetroAchievements menu in your emulator and then click on Rich Presence Monitor. A small window will show you your active RP.

If the next line starts with a question mark, it is considered to be a conditional display string. The portion of the line between the two question marks is the conditional clause. If the conditional clause evaluates true, then the remaining portion of the line is used as the display string. If it does not evaluate true, then processing proceeds to the next line. If it starts with a question mark, the same process repeats. If it does not start with a question mark, the entire line is used as the default display string.

            "text": "This is a guide on how to think about and design good achievements. Not the technical side but the conceptual.\n\n\nThis content is a summary of what was \noriginally written by RA user cirellio on a forum topic\n.\n\n\nProgression Based Achievements\n\n\nThere are 3 types of progression based achievements: simple progression, story-based progression, and progression/collection achievements.\n\n\nSimple Progression\n\n\nProgression-based achievements are usually simplest ones, especially if the game you are doing is nothing but linear stages. Or doesn't have much going on in the way of storylines. In this case, let's look at some GOOD and BAD examples of this:\n\n\n\n\nGood: Clear stage 1. \n\n\nBad: Reach stage 2. \n\n\n\n\nIt takes slightly more work to code an achievement where the player is required to clear the stage rather than simply reach the next one. But it is also much more satisfying for the player, and it is much more professional-looking. It is also \nless susceptible to problems with players loading save games or savestates for freebie achievements en masse\n. \n\n\n\n\nGood: Complete the game. \n\n\nBad: Start the game. \n\n\n\n\nWhile it is true progression-based achievements are often freebies, it is generally agreed upon here that an achievement to start the game is a bit too easy, and not at all memorable for the player. It's just a formality. The ending of the game, however, is often the most memorable part of a game for a player, and completing a game is definitely an achievement in itself. It's a good practice to make such achievement work like \"Beat last stage and beat the game\".\n\n\n\n\nGood: Cleared the ice theme stages, or Cleared the first five stages, or Cleared the first ten stages. \n\n\nBad: Complete Stage 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11-200 (all separate achievements) \n\n\n\n\nOne of the worst things you can do is create achievement spam. Puzzle games are notorious for these kinds of problems, because the stages are short and often, there are one-hundred of them or more. As a result, the main page feed ends up with a lot of micro-updates, which spams other folks' achievements down and off the front page quickly. The way to come off as more professional in this matter is to space out the achievements a bit more, into groups of stages. For instance, if stages 1-10 are all fire themed, and stages 11-20 are all outer-space themed, you can create achievements around these themes. Be creative. \n\n\nStory Based Progression:\n\n\nThe most memorable moments in gaming history are often not related to item collection or sidequests, but to specific scenes relating to the story. \n\n\nExamples:\n\n- First encounter with Pyramid Head in the Silent Hill series. \n- Finding out the truth about Darth Revan in Knights of the Old Republic. \n- Finding out what will happen in the future in Chrono Trigger. \n- Launching the Cow in Earthworm Jim. \n- Pretty much any character death. \n\n\nThe thing you have to be extra-careful with here is spoilers. If you catch a progression-based achievement that has a spoiler in it, by all means contact the dev about it. And devs, please be receptive when it comes to constructive criticism! Also, the number and even percentage of these will vary from game to game--The dependance lies heavily upon how story-driven the game is. \n\n\nProgression/Collection\n\n\nProgression/Collection is a common hybrid. Not only are you collecting an item, but it also launches into a memorable (and mandatory) scene. \n\n\nExamples:\n\n- Obtaining the Master Sword in Link to the Past, which lifts the curse in the Lost Woods. \n- Finding the sword on the beach in Link's Awakening, which launches into the first scene where the wise owl speaks to you. \n- Picking your starter Pokemon, which happens during a beginning scene, but is a 'rite of passage' for most gamers. \n\n\nAchievements in this hybrid category are often more satisfying because they are pulling double-duty. The player is not only obtaining an item, but watching a memorable scene and nabbing an achievement all at once. Quite the rush of endorphins! \n\n\nProgression Pros and Cons\n\n\nProgression Achievements are guaranteed to the player on a normal play-through. So why even have them? \n\n\nPros\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA player deserves points for playing through a game! They do! Remember, a lot of folks are playing through these games for the very first time, and most games are quite hard to beat. Why shouldn't we reward players for a good ol' normal play-through? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriodic progression awards go a long way to encourage players to complete a game. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome players are more casual and don't intend to do much more than beat games on this website. Not everyone feels the need to Master every game in Hardcore mode. Many are perfectly happy grabbing whatever convenient side-achievements they can during a normal play-through, and there's nothing wrong with that. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome scenes are so memorable, they deserve achievements all their own! People who grew up with these games and love them look for these scenes in achievement lists, and it might just warm their heart when they see it was acknowledged. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgression Achievements help other people on the website gauge how far along a player is in a game, a bit like Rich Presence. We can drop a line to the player and say, \"Good luck!\" because we know the next section is pretty tricky. It encourages the community to interact. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder matters! Progression Achievements can tell us a lot about a play-through just by the order they occurred. If you pop that optional boss achievement and saved up a million dollars AFTER you've already done all the sidequests, that's much less impressive than if you manage to pull it off well before the mid-point of the game. In other words, Progression Achievements allow us to show-off a bit! We can show the world that we can beat that final boss before we've reached level 10, or that we can beat Expert mode on our first go before Easy and Normal. \nIt can even reveal if we've used glitches or cheats to skip certain portions of the game\n. So, as you can see, Progression Achievements have great SYNERGY with other kinds of achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese kinds of achievements are the easiest to code and are generally error-free. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToo many Progression Achievements can over-saturate a game with 'freebies', and that's a Very Bad Thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your entire game has nothing but these kinds of achievements, it's just another boring run through the game for players. Reach stage 2, Reach stage 3, Reach stage 4, Complete the Game. This is a great 'base' for you to start adding achievements from the other categories, but \ndon't leave your list at just Progression Achievements\n if you can help it. Otherwise you're just rewarding players full points for going through the motions like they've done a million times before. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSidequest/Optional Achievements\n\n\nVintage games, on their own, offer little-to-no incentive to beat a bonus mode, other than that it's something to do on a rainy day after you've beaten the game. Old games didn't have internet connectivity. And they had no social aspects other than 2-player mode, and maybe telling your friends at school that you beat something. But now, with RetroAchievements.org, we can display our vintage trophies (even though it requires us to redo what we've probably already done many years ago). These trophies are badges of honor. You can look at another member's Challenge Achievements and begin to understand how far they went, how skilled they are. Along with that comes respect from the other members. We socialize, we congratulate each other on a job well done. We feel like we belong, and we are in good company.\n\n\nSidequests\n\n\nThere are often things the player can do that are confined to the rules of the game, but aren't necessary to complete it. In other words, a challenge built into the game by the original game developers. Usually they are fun, or sometimes not so fun, but deserve an award because they require hard work and persistence to achieve. You have to walk a fine tightrope between if dedicated players are likely to do something, vs. if the goal is stupid. People will have differing views over this, so steel yourself.\n\n\nOften times, these types of achievements are even Easter Eggs or things the player never knew existed in their entire lives! Many players adore these types of achievements. I think it's because they learn something new about a game they grew up with, or feel like maybe they were the only ones who knew about a given secret and were excited to see it supported here. \nIt's important for us developers to REALLY know a game inside-and-out before creating an achievement set.\n\n\nExamples of Sidequests:\n\n- Delivering tails to the Tail Collector in Final Fantasy IV. \n- Finding the owner of the Insignificant Item in Earthbound. \n- Giving the Jerky to the King in Guardia Castle. \n- Anju sidequest in Majora's Mask. \n- Learning about Wrex's past in Mass Effect. \n- Diplomat/VIP escort missions in Flashback: The Quest for Identity. \n- Discovering a secret room. \n\n\nSidequests are most often found in RPGs, but especially these days, sidequests are finding their way into just about every genre. Keep your eyes peeled - Even the unsuspecting platformer may have a sidequest or three. The Kirby series, for instance, has many hidden rooms and areas. Often times, sidequests end up awarding an item, which falls under a hybrid: Sidequest/Collection.\n\n\nOptional Achievements\n\n\nExamples of Optional Achievements:\n\n- Optional bosses. \n- Clearing a challenge dungeon (which is a hybrid of Sidequest). \n- Completing Expert Mode (which is a hybrid of Progression). \n- Completing a secret challenge level. \n- Getting an exceptionally rare drop off of a monster. \n- Clearing the game with an optional character. \n- Getting a high score. \n- Completing features only unlocked on a second playthrough. \n- Game modes that are only unlocked on multiple playthroughs. \n- Optional game endings. \n- Codes you can enter during the title screen to make the game harder. \n\n\nThis is the game makers hoping you'll like their game enough to keep coming back for more, even after those ending credits scroll by. They are trying to reward the player for completing their game, and create some form of satisfying re-playability. If the game makers went to the trouble making things like this an integral part of the game, we as achievement developers should recognize these challenges and create appropriate achievements for at least a few of them.\n\n\nChrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Star Ocean: The Second Story are famous for this. The Game Boy Advance Castlevania entries also do this. In fact, many games do this. If you aren't sure if your game has any extra modes or challenges, be sure to do some research and check out some FAQs. Or ask the community here, many of us are experts on the games supported here. \n\n\nSidequest/Optional Pros and Cons\n\n\nSidequest/Optional Achievements make fantastic supplements to Progression Achievements. \n\n\nPros\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the bread-and-butter of achievement making. Chances are, a good deal of your achievements will come from this category. All games have optional things to do. Collect all the coins in a stage! Gain 9 lives! Creating achievements for this stuff is easy, and it rewards the player for their dedication. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame makers love appreciative players. They like it when players bother to dig deeper into their games, appreciating their hard work, otherwise we wouldn't see hidden 'fun' things in games like Easter Eggs, bonus scenes, etc. If game makers reward the players for doing it, why shouldn't we? Us devs should also recognize that the player has gone the extra mile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame players love telling their friends when they find something unusual and off the beaten path in a game. With this site, they can show their friends that they did indeed slay the elusive 'yellow frog' rarely seen in the marsh, or found the warp to the 'mystery dimension'. If we include these curiosities in our achievement lists, we show the players that we are 'in the know', which builds confidence that we can competently guide them through the game. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSidequest/Optional Achievements give players something to strive for after they've beaten the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese kinds of achievements can often be earned at any time and are not on a predictable schedule. Players feel an extra rush of endorphins when an achievement pops that they weren't expecting, but it was earned. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese kinds of achievements are usually easy to code, second only to progression-style achievements. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome players don't care to explore beyond what a typical play-through has to offer, so a high percentage of these types of achievements in a game can leave a player under-rewarded. (Granted, this type of gamer is a bit of a rare bird on a website centered around achievements.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome people may feel a specific challenge is too hard, even if it's something the original game developers included in-game for players to achieve. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create a Sidequest/Optional Achievement for, say, running away from 999 battles (or other stat-maxing achievements), you risk that the people on this website may not feel this particular achievement offers a challenge and is just a 'grind-fest'. Achievements like this may very well end up getting demoted unless they serve a second purpose, like in Final Fantasy V where running away from battles actually powers up a weapon called the 'Chicken Knife'. This has SYNERGY with the game, as opposed to creating an achievement based upon raising a stat that has no other use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollection Based Achievements\n\n\nMost collection-based achievements are optional, unless the items themselves are MacGuffins, which in that case they would fall squarely under Progression/Collection.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n- Finding the Mickey hats hidden in the background to obtain 1-ups in Genesis Aladdin. \n- Finding exceptionally well-hidden items. \n- Bestiaries. \n- Unlocking an optional character. \n- Maxing out Money/kills/stats. \n- Finding all the different ways to die in games like Prince of Persia or Shadowgate. \n- Opening every treasure chest in a game/finding every powerup. \n- All items/Collecting 99 or 255 (etc.) of an item. \n- Catching them all in Pokemon (any monster collection, really.) \n\n\nIf the game keeps track of a stat, the game developer is practically daring you to max it out. Now you might be that kind of player, and you might not. You have to ask yourself, as a dev, whether or not other players are likely to get 9999 vampire bat kills, even if you wouldn't. The advantages to this are that people who wouldn't normally do this always have something to come back and work for when they feel like playing the game again. The disadvantage is that other players who wouldn't normally go that far and never would, but also feel like they have to MASTER every game quickly (a rare breed), will complain. If you get enough complaints, you might want to bring down that 9999 to something more reasonable, like 500. If no one's having fun with an achievement, it's not in the spirit of playing games or making achievements. \n\n\nYou have to use your better judgment here and think of what the player would enjoy the most. As a rule of thumb, it's better to have a few Sidequest/Optional Achievements than none at all. But with a little extra effort, these achievements can make your list very memorable. \n\n\nNext, it's time to roll up our sleeves as devs and get REALLY creative when the devs themselves challenge the player beyond the rules of the game.\n\n\nFor-Fun achievements\n\n\nThis kind of achievements usually worths just a few points, but they are still fun\n\n\nExamples of For Fun:\n\n- Letting the clock hit 99:59 in Valkyrie Profile. \n- Interactive backgrounds, such as poking the hanging dead body in stage 1 of Castlevania: Bloodlines. \n- Cooking the hamster in the microwave in Maniac Mansion. \n- Watching the apocalypse in Majora's Mask. \n- Finding John Romero in Doom 2. \n\n\nSometimes, game makers add fun easter eggs. They went the extra mile to entertain the player with 'what if's'. Again, it is our job as devs to recognize and support these as much as we can.\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\nOne thing that you have to remember about retro gamers - and the games they play - is that most of us have played these games a million times before. This is the same old song and dance for most of us, and we often need motivation to do it again. Some of us can clear Contra without losing a single life. Well, now is our chance to prove it! \n\n\nI mean, think about it: Before this website, about the only way to prove you can do a flawless run of Contra was to invite a friend over, sit him down, and show him, or figure out recording software and make a YouTube video. But even then, a lot of those videos are doctored to look like flawless playthroughs. This site, however, has Hardcore mode, which help to indicate no one is cheating. \n\n\nYou may have Progression Achievements and Sidequest/Optional Achievements, but if you want to create an achievement list that's truly great, you need at least a few Challenge Achievements. Try to think back to all the games you've played here at this website. What are some of the most memorable achievements? I can almost guarantee you that they were Challenge Achievements. There are exceptions to the rule, of course, but the typical player isn't going to fondly recall, 'Cleared Stage 2-6', or 'Reached Level 30'. They are more likely to fondly remember achievements that made their play-throughs a unique experience, such as...\n\n\n\n\nget through the entire game without ever picking up a powerup or coin\n\n\ndefeat a boss without getting hit\n\n\nfinish a stage without losing a life\n\n\n\n\nThat is what makes this website so special, and what makes achievements something more than just beating a game. \n\n\nEven the most vocal critics who hate the idea of Achievements may say, \"Well, except for THIS one. This one was okay.\" And I guarantee you that ONE example they're talking about is a Challenge Achievement, something that challenged the player beyond the game itself. \n\n\nA good achievement developer will keep their eyes peeled, their wits about them, and their senses sharp when developing a game, looking for good, unusual challenges. They may notice something in the game that's a difficult feat.\n\n\nSpeedrun Challenges\n\n\nTimers introduce an added pressure players may have never felt before while playing their favorite games. Few things get the heart pumping more than an imposing ticking clock. Add a timer element, and a game that was previously so easy they could beat it blindfolded could suddenly be transformed into the ultimate gaming challenge of their lives. \n\n\nExamples of Speedrun Challenges:\n\n- Completing a game in under one hour. \n- Clearing a specific stage in under three minutes. \n- Undercut the timer by a certain number of seconds. \n- Kill 30 vampire bats during the escape sequence. \n- Collect 99 bonus coins before the bonus screen fades away. \n- Go from point A to point B before day changes to night. \n- Leaderboard - Complete the game with the fastest time possible. \n- Leaderboard - Complete a given stage with the fastest time possible. \n\n\nA dev may want to head out to YouTube or Twitch and see how fast people are finishing a game (And please ignore TAS - \"Tool Assisted Speedruns\"). Some pro speed-runners are so fast, the typical player here won't stand a chance at the times being posted, but you should be able to find a happy medium. And if you can't figure out a good time to challenge the players here, that's what Leaderboards are for - Turn it into a competition! In fact, some of your favorite celebrity speed-runners may come to this very site and submit a time or two. \n\n\nYou'll know when you're facing a pressure achievement when your palms are sweating and you find yourself nervously glancing at the timer. Like I said before, nothing screams, \"Wake up!\" louder than a timer, especially when developers start weaving this kind of achievement with OTHER kinds of achievements (and even leaderboards) during a timed portion of a game. Timer Challenges have an insane amount of synergy with other types of achievements. \n\n\nLimitation Challenges\n\n\nExamples of Limitation Challenges:\n\n- Clear a battle or even an entire game with all characters of a specific job class. (One famous example of this is clearing the original Final Fantasy with a group of White Mages.) \n- Beat a final boss with no equipment on. \n- Clear a stage without ever jumping. \n- Solve a puzzle in only two moves. \n- One-hit KOs. \n- Low level games (LLGs). \n- No hit achievements. \n- Never hit certain button(s) during a challenge. \n- Never lose invincibility through an entire Mario 3 stage by finding enough Starmen. \n- Defeat a certain enemy without using a certain move. \n- Reaching Ganon in Legend of Zelda, sword-less. \n- Defeat a certain enemy ONLY using a certain move. \n- Stumble your way through a maze while drunk/confused. \n- Clear the game with a status ailment. \n\n\nCommunity websites built around certain games are a fantastic resource for these kinds of achievements They'll have a good idea about what's possible and impossible, and have likely written up FAQs discussing alternative and challenging ways to play the entire game. \n\n\nOften times, though, there will be no community. No FAQs. No Message Board. And maybe even no useful videos. In these cases, you'll need to be an idea person to come up with new and interesting ways to challenge the player. Be aware that these kinds of achievements take a lot of practice, time, and experience to create. \n\n\nThe takeaway here is to BE CREATIVE! And remember to keep it FUN! \n\n\nScore Challenges\n\n\nExamples of Score Challenges:\n\n- Completing a game or level with the lowest possible score. \n- Complete a minigame with a perfect score (not just topping the CPU leaderboard). \n- Leaderboard - Complete the game with the highest score/most money/best kill count/etc. possible. \n- Leaderboard - Complete a given stage with the highest score/most money/best kill count/etc. possible. \n\n\nChallenge Pros and Cons\n\n\nChallenge Achievements are your chance to show players how to play their favorite games in different, unique, and even mind-bending ways. While these achievements can breathe life into an otherwise dull achievement set, you generally only want a small handful of these to be in your final list. \n\n\nPros\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardcore players love sinking their teeth into these kinds of achievements. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf some players are too hardcore, you can find a happy medium by implementing Leaderboards, which satisfies both the casual achievement hunters and the hardcore players all at once. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is your chance to be very creative and come up with new challenges for players they never expected. This can be a pleasant surprise and really make your lists memorable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese types of achievements require a fair amount of creativity to dream up, though there are many ways to research unusual ways to play games by watching things like speed runs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay require a deep research. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese can be notoriously difficult to code. They require you to make a lot of code notes, make tons of game mechanic observations, and often times they require bug testing before they even work. In fact, you may not even be ready to tackle achievements like this until you've had a few games under your belt with a set of baseline achievements. Fortunately, Challenge Achievements can always be added later. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal Resources\n\n\n\n\nBest practices achievement creation guide\n written by Jeff Sullivan, Developer Account Manager of XNA Developer Connection (XDC) regarding XBox 360 Achievements.\n\n\nMake them Work for it\n an achievement design guide written by by Darran Jamieson on 1 Jan 2013.\n\n\nThe Achievement Machine: Understanding Xbox 360 Achievements in Gaming Practices\n - by Mikael Jakobsson",

It takes slightly more work to code an achievement where the player is required to clear the stage rather than simply reach the next one. But it is also much more satisfying for the player, and it is much more professional-looking. It is also  less susceptible to problems with players loading save games or savestates for freebie achievements en masse .    Good: Complete the game.   Bad: Start the game.    While it is true progression-based achievements are often freebies, it is generally agreed upon here that an achievement to start the game is a bit too easy, and not at all memorable for the player. It's just a formality. The ending of the game, however, is often the most memorable part of a game for a player, and completing a game is definitely an achievement in itself. It's a good practice to make such achievement work like \"Beat last stage and beat the game\".   Good: Cleared the ice theme stages, or Cleared the first five stages, or Cleared the first ten stages.   Bad: Complete Stage 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11-200 (all separate achievements)    One of the worst things you can do is create achievement spam. Puzzle games are notorious for these kinds of problems, because the stages are short and often, there are one-hundred of them or more. As a result, the main page feed ends up with a lot of micro-updates, which spams other folks' achievements down and off the front page quickly. The way to come off as more professional in this matter is to space out the achievements a bit more, into groups of stages. For instance, if stages 1-10 are all fire themed, and stages 11-20 are all outer-space themed, you can create achievements around these themes. Be creative.",

The thing you have to be extra-careful with here is spoilers. If you catch a progression-based achievement that has a spoiler in it, by all means contact the dev about it.

Remember, a lot of folks are playing through these games for the very first time, and most games are quite hard to beat. Why shouldn't we reward players for a good ol' normal play-through?     Periodic progression awards go a long way to encourage players to complete a game.     Some players are more casual and don't intend to do much more than beat games on this website. Not everyone feels the need to Master every game in Hardcore mode. Many are perfectly happy grabbing whatever convenient side-achievements they can during a normal play-through, and there's nothing wrong with that.     Some scenes are so memorable, they deserve achievements all their own! People who grew up with these games and love them look for these scenes in achievement lists, and it might just warm their heart when they see it was acknowledged.     Progression Achievements help other people on the website gauge how far along a player is in a game, a bit like Rich Presence. We can drop a line to the player and say, \"Good luck!\" because we know the next section is pretty tricky. It encourages the community to interact.     Order matters! Progression Achievements can tell us a lot about a play-through just by the order they occurred. If you pop that optional boss achievement and saved up a million dollars AFTER you've already done all the sidequests, that's much less impressive than if you manage to pull it off well before the mid-point of the game. In other words, Progression Achievements allow us to show-off a bit! We can show the world that we can beat that final boss before we've reached level 10, or that we can beat Expert mode on our first go before Easy and Normal.  It can even reveal if we've used glitches or cheats to skip certain portions of the game . So, as you can see, Progression Achievements have great SYNERGY with other kinds of achievements.

You have to walk a fine tightrope between if dedicated players are likely to do something, vs. if the goal is stupid. People will have differing views over this, so steel yourself.  Often times, these types of achievements are even Easter Eggs or things the player never knew existed in their entire lives! Many players adore these types of achievements. I think it's because they learn something new about a game they grew up with, or feel like maybe they were the only ones who knew about a given secret and were excited to see it supported here.  It's important for us developers to REALLY know a game inside-and-out before creating an achievement set.  Examples of Sidequests: \n- Delivering tails to the Tail Collector in Final Fantasy IV. \n- Finding the owner of the Insignificant Item in Earthbound. \n- Giving the Jerky to the King in Guardia Castle. \n- Anju sidequest in Majora's Mask. \n- Learning about Wrex's past in Mass Effect. \n- Diplomat/VIP escort missions in Flashback: The Quest for Identity. \n- Discovering a secret room.   Sidequests are most often found in RPGs, but especially these days, sidequests are finding their way into just about every genre.

If the game makers went to the trouble making things like this an integral part of the game, we as achievement developers should recognize these challenges and create appropriate achievements for at least a few of them.  Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Star Ocean: The Second Story are famous for this. The Game Boy Advance Castlevania entries also do this. In fact, many games do this.

Some people may feel a specific challenge is too hard, even if it's something the original game developers included in-game for players to achieve.     When you create a Sidequest/Optional Achievement for, say, running away from 999 battles (or other stat-maxing achievements), you risk that the people on this website may not feel this particular achievement offers a challenge and is just a 'grind-fest'. Achievements like this may very well end up getting demoted unless they serve a second purpose, like in Final Fantasy V where running away from battles actually powers up a weapon called the 'Chicken Knife'.

If the game keeps track of a stat, the game developer is practically daring you to max it out. Now you might be that kind of player, and you might not. You have to ask yourself, as a dev, whether or not other players are likely to get 9999 vampire bat kills, even if you wouldn't. The advantages to this are that people who wouldn't normally do this always have something to come back and work for when they feel like playing the game again. The disadvantage is that other players who wouldn't normally go that far and never would, but also feel like they have to MASTER every game quickly (a rare breed), will complain. If you get enough complaints, you might want to bring down that 9999 to something more reasonable, like 500. If no one's having fun with an achievement, it's not in the spirit of playing games or making achievements.   You have to use your better judgment here and think of what the player would enjoy the most. As a rule of thumb, it's better to have a few Sidequest/Optional Achievements than none at all.

Even the most vocal critics who hate the idea of Achievements may say, \"Well, except for THIS one. This one was okay.\" And I guarantee you that ONE example they're talking about is a Challenge Achievement, something that challenged the player beyond the game itself.

Or maybe some fun extras just cluttered up your core?  Have a high amount of requests for something that just seemed out of place in core?  RetroAchievements is encouraging and welcoming of these challenges and fun, but we'd like to stay organized.  Bonus points for popular sets are a great idea!\n\n\nWhat should I include in a Bonus Set?\n\n\nSets designed to test a Mastery's skill and provide a new challenge and bonus fun.  You should always follow the \"Is this really different?\" when deciding on Bonus Set Achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Extras\n: Sometimes a game just needs more fun!  Have things that just wouldn't fit to core?  A Bonus Set is a good place for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery challenging\n: If its generally voiced an Achievement is \ntoo difficult\n for the casual player, its a prime candidate for your Bonus Set.  Keep in mind you should limit the difficulty on such a set so that a human can still get them.  Most Expert gamers are still not speed-run quality material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Secrets or Grind Sessions\n: These typically would frustrate a casual player to no end.  But a Bonus Set player would enjoy the challenge.  Examples:  \"Get all characters to max level\", \"Max Strength, Defense, Magic on all Characters\", \"Hit object X number of times\", \"Win # of Mini-Games\", \"Get X rare item\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I create a Bonus Set?\n\n\nYou should of course \npitch the idea first\n .  It is your duty and a rule to do so.\n\n\nCurrently, creating a Bonus Set is not easy.  You must apply a non-destructive hack to a copy of the original ROM file and release the IPS patch which includes the differences for people to be able to enjoy it.  Patching a ROM file with an IPS patcher is relatively easy.  A player enjoying ROM hacks for additional challenges is well-versed in the procedure.  Creating a safe non-destructive IPS patch, however, is your challenge should you choose to accept it.\n\n\nMore often than not an \nadmin\n (such as \nSalsa\n, whom is head of the Bonus Set project patch creation) will be able to put you on the right track.  If you just develop achievements, diving into creating the appropriate patch can be cumbersome and confusing.\n\n\nIf you're a programmer and an artist at that and aware of the proper use of hacking utilities, the steps are provided below for you for generating a cosmetic IPS patch.  Make sure to follow the \nguidelines!\n\n\nNOTE\n\n\nThis method will change as Bonus Set becomes an integrated feature of RetroAchievements and the RetroAchievements emulators.  You can however contribute artful IPS patches and sets for the addition of this automatic feature in the meantime.\n\n\nStep 1\n - Obtain the original game\n\n\nThe first step in designing your Bonus Set is picking up the original game ROM.  We cannot provide a download venue for this.

A Bonus Set is a good place for them.    Very challenging : If its generally voiced an Achievement is  too difficult  for the casual player, its a prime candidate for your Bonus Set.  Keep in mind you should limit the difficulty on such a set so that a human can still get them.  Most Expert gamers are still not speed-run quality material.

You must apply a non-destructive hack to a copy of the original ROM file and release the IPS patch which includes the differences for people to be able to enjoy it.  Patching a ROM file with an IPS patcher is relatively easy.  A player enjoying ROM hacks for additional challenges is well-versed in the procedure.  Creating a safe non-destructive IPS patch, however, is your challenge should you choose to accept it.  More often than not an  admin  (such as  Salsa , whom is head of the Bonus Set project patch creation) will be able to put you on the right track.  If you just develop achievements, diving into creating the appropriate patch can be cumbersome and confusing.  If you're a programmer and an artist at that and aware of the proper use of hacking utilities, the steps are provided below for you for generating a cosmetic IPS patch.  Make sure to follow the  guidelines!  NOTE  This method will change as Bonus Set becomes an integrated feature of RetroAchievements and the RetroAchievements emulators.

In fact most part of what we have here were originally taken from those forum posts, but ordered in a somewhat more coherent sequence.\n\n\nThe \nRetroAchievements Documentation Project\n is divided into two parts:\n\n\n\n\nRetroAchievements wiki\n\n\nRetroAchievements docs\n\n\n\n\nThe wiki is where these documents are created and edited. Anyone (with a github account) is able to edit the wiki's content. Then, if you have something to share, please edit the wiki!\n\n\nThe \nRetroAchievements docs\n website has (almost) the same content as the wiki, but with a more pleasant look. The content of this website is generated by its maintainers using the wiki's content as input.\n\n\nWhen a change is made in the wiki this change is NOT instantaneously reflected in the docs.\n The convertion is performed by a maintainer from time to time.",
